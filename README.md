## Installation

> **Warning**
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) and should not be used in production, try it in a VM for a while! This is my personal image, which I manage for myself. You may copy from or use this repo, but I will offer **no** support or guarantee of function.

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/oakleafknight06/startingleaf:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/oakleafknight06/startingleaf:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

This repository builds date tags as well, so if you want to rebase to a particular day's build:

```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/oakleafknight06/startingleaf:20230403
```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.
